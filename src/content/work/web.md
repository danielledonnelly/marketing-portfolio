>#### Drafting and editing
Whether you're looking to build a site from scratch or update it with new content, I have you covered. I have experience writing for a range of audiences across various platforms, and know how to implent SEO to ensure your content gets the reach it deserves.

>#### Responsive design
I have experience designing eye-catching sites in both a personal and professional capacity. Using Canva and Figma, I can draft a variety of
