### Holistic management of online experiences

<!-- >#### Drafting and editing

>#### Responsive design, clear communication
I have experience designing eye-catching sites in both a personal and professional capacity. Using Canva and Figma, I can draft a variety of

 I have also built many self-directed projects of my own with tools like Visual Studio Code, GitHub Pages, and Cloudflare Pages.
