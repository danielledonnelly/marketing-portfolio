>#### Drafting and editing
Whether you're looking to build a site from scratch or update it with new content, I have you covered. I have experience writing for a range of audiences across various platforms, and know how to implent SEO to ensure your content gets the reach it deserves.

>#### Responsive design
I have experience designing eye-catching sites in both a personal and professional capacity. Using Canva and Figma, I can draft a variety of
visuals for whatever your project needs.

>#### Bringing it all together
 I've managed professional websites using a range of CMS: WordPress, Prismic, and ExpressionEngine. I've also built many independent projects with tools like Visual Studio Code, GitHub Pages, and Cloudflare Pages. Whether you're looking to update an existing site or build one from scratch, I have you covered.
